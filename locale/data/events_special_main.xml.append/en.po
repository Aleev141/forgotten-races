"\tDeveloped by Gabriel Cooper and HereticChurch\n"
"\tCurrently Enabled.\n"
"    \n"
"\tThis mod brings back the in-cannon extinct subclass of the Ancients/Obelisks called the \"Commonwealth\". It adds content for the now almost extinct salt people race and a new cruiser line for the osmians, as well as a brand new sector with unique music and a few unlocks beacons all throughout the game.\n"
"\n"
"\tForgotten Races also adds 146 new ships, 141 weapons and drones not counting artilleries (mostly exclusive to said ships), 54 new crews that can be found on the new ships, a revived questline with dozens of unlocks that wasn't implemented to multiverse years ago and 2 new renegade bosses, both with exclusive weapons. Those ships all have some kinda gimmick, not all of them have a very complicated one however."
