Legends say this ship is now owned by a equinoid arch demon of Tartarus, one which calls themselves the "Prince of Darkness". The ship hails you, though no words are spoken, the demon simply stares into your soul, their words being branded into your very mind.
	
	"Yet another mortal steps up to challenge me it seems. I will be blunt with you, little creature, you are about to face a being from the very depts of the intangeble, one which has seen eons by. This is not a threat, it's only a warning. Gather your wits and face me, for great rewards away anyone who can best me in combat."</text>

"Fear not, mortal, for I'm not here to fight you, only award your spoils of war. I shall grand you the schematics of my very ship and its wonderful technology, as well as my very own weapon, one which I forged myself a millenia ago.

The ship's design is, however, completely unique from anything you have encountered so far, its lights drawing your mind in and fighting to keep it. After you finally regain your senses, you realize that this ship is so enigmatic that it doesn't have any legends attached to it, no stories, no database details, nothing.

		Suddunly you feel a strong force hit your mind, the being in charge of the ship is trying to communicate to you, its words sear your mind, the pain is indescribable. "C H I L D   O F   M A N,  D O   N O T   R E S I S T   T H E   C A L L,  S U B M I T."</text>
