It doesn't have to end this way, I have enough power in the federation to convince their leaders to agree to aid the Hive in rebuilding any damage caused by the fed mantis war, if you agree to leave the coalition we will do everything we can to make sure the Hive has a loyal ally in the battles to come! Please, don't this end in more bloodshed!"</text>

Unfortunately I can't sign any pacts as of yet, this transition must be slow, otherwise we may have issues with opposing ideas from the lesser mantis."
