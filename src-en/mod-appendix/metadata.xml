PATCH AFTER MULTIVERSE, REQUIRES INFERNO CORE 1.2+ AND THE RENEGADE COLLECTION, PATCH BOTH OF THOSE BEFORE FR

This mod brings back the in-cannon extinct subclass of the Ancients/Obelisks called the "Commonwealth". It adds content for the now almost extinct salt people race and a new cruiser line for the osmians, as well as a brand new sector with unique music and a few unlocks beacons all throughout the game.

Forgotten Races also adds 136 new ships, 138 weapons and drones not counting artilleries (mostly exclusive to said ships), 50 new crews that can be found on the new ships, a revived questline with dozens of unlocks that wasn't implemented to multiverse years ago and 2 new renegade bosses, both with exclusive weapons. Those ships all have some kinda gimmick, not all of them have a very complicated one however.

Thanks to the playtesters: DemonFusion, Altzeus, FilteredTea, RoseNebula, Cobaltsong and Sword Freshman

(Huge thanks to Cyrus, Altzeus, DemonFusion and Julk who helped this mod a lot over the course of its development, this little addon wouldn't be nowhere near what it is now without their help)
